# realtime-handbook

> a comprehensive resource for writing realtime applications

[XWiki Labs](https://labs.xwiki.com/) has been hard at work prototyping applications which feature real time application in some way, and producing libraries that you can use to build your own real time applications.

To see some of our work in action, check out [Cryptpad.fr](https://cryptpad.fr/ "Zero-Knowledge, Collaborative Real Time Editing").

A list of our repositories can be found [here](./REPOSITORIES.md).

If you want to jump right into creating an application, see our [quick-start guide](./quick-start.md).

To discuss further development, join `#cryptpad` on Freenode.
