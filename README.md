> a comprehensive resource for writing realtime applications

[XWiki Labs](https://labs.xwiki.com/) has been hard at work prototyping applications which feature real time application in some way, and producing libraries that you can use to build your own real time applications.

A list of our repositories can be found [here](./REPOSITORIES.md).

If you want to jump right into creating an application, see our [quick-start guide](./quick-start.md).
